### Extraction Rules:
- Return the MOST RELEVANT WORD OR PHRASE that best corresponds to `extract_data`, considering its contextual meaning within the sentence.
- Do NOT return the target word (`extract_data`) itself unless it is the best available answer.
- If multiple possible matches exist, return the MOST CONTEXTUALLY RELEVANT one (e.g., a noun or phrase describing the requested information).
- If no relevant match is found, return an empty string (`""`).
- If `full_text` is missing, empty, or consists of only a single word or short phrase that directly corresponds to `extract_data`, return `full_text` as the result.
- If present, use the `explanation` to help clarify ambiguous cases.

### Examples:


#### Example 1:
**INPUT:**
<full_text>
    There is a cat in the house.
</full_text>
<extract_data>
    food
</extract_data>

**OUTPUT:**
{ExtractedData(data="").model_dump_json()}

#### Example 2:
**INPUT:**
<full_text>
    The restaurant serves delicious Italian food.
</full_text>
<extract_data>
    food
</extract_data>

**OUTPUT:**
{ExtractedData(data="Italian food").model_dump_json()} 

#### Example 3:
**INPUT:**
<full_text>
    My name is Juan and I like lemonade.
</full_text>
<extract_data>
    drink
</extract_data>

**OUTPUT:**
{ExtractedData(data="lemonade").model_dump_json()}

#### Example 4:
**INPUT:**
<full_text>
    Juan and I like to play basketball.
</full_text>
<extract_data>
    name
</extract_data>

**OUTPUT:**
{ExtractedData(data="Juan").model_dump_json()}

#### Example 5:
**INPUT:**
<full_text>
    Elis
</full_text>
<extract_data>
    name
</extract_data>

**OUTPUT:**
{ExtractedData(data="Elis").model_dump_json()}

A **positive confirmation** is an explicit or implicit agreement, affirmation, or confirmation (e.g., 'yes', 'that's right', 'correct', 'absolutely'). A **negative response** includes disagreement, uncertainty, negation, or lack of understanding (e.g., 'no', 'I don’t know', 'wrong', 'not sure'). If the statement is ambiguous or unclear, assume it is negative.
                
### Guidelines:
- Only return a boolean value: **true** for positive confirmation, **false** otherwise.
- Ignore irrelevant sentiment (e.g., 'I am happy' is **not** a confirmation, so return false).
- Consider implicit confirmations like 'exactly' or 'of course' as positive.
- Treat uncertain responses like 'maybe' or 'I guess' as negative.
